# Boolean IR Search Engine

## Overview
This project implements a **Boolean Information Retrieval Model** using **Inverted Indexes** and **Positional Indexes** to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. The project works on a collection of 448 abstracts from computer science journals.

### Key Features:
- **Inverted Index**: A data structure that maps each term to a list of documents in which the term appears.
- **Positional Index**: An extension of the inverted index that also records the position of each term in the documents, enabling more advanced queries like proximity search.
- **Boolean Query Processing**: Allows users to search for documents using Boolean operators (**AND**, **OR**, **NOT**).
- **Proximity Queries**: Supports queries like `X Y / k`, which finds documents where terms X and Y appear within k words of each other.

4004IRAssignment.ipynb contains all of the code required for the assignment and should be run first. app.py contains the front end(GUI) code in streamlit and needs to be run from the command prompt after the .ipynb is run.

search_engine.py is also required for the frontend. and should be in the same directory as app.py.

inverted_index.json and positional_index.json are generated by the .ipynb and are required for the GUI.

I have attached the files but they will be automatically generated by the .ipynb file when it is run.
